The provided Python script is a basic calculator program that allows users to perform four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Here's a brief description of the key components and functionalities of the calculator script:
Function Definitions:
add(x, y): Adds two numbers x and y.
subtract(x, y): Subtracts y from x.
multiply(x, y): Multiplies two numbers x and y.
divide(x, y): Divides x by y if y is not zero; otherwise, returns an error message for division by zero.
User Interface:

The script presents a menu to the user, displaying the available operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
The user is prompted to enter their choice (1, 2, 3, or 4) corresponding to the desired operation.
User Input:

After selecting the operation, the user is prompted to input two numbers (num1 and num2) on which the chosen operation will be performed.
Operation Execution:

Based on the user's choice, the script calls the appropriate function to perform the selected arithmetic operation on the input numbers.
If the user chooses division (choice == '4'), the script checks for division by zero before performing the operation.
Output:

The script prints the result of the chosen operation or an error message in case of division by zero.
The output includes the input numbers and the corresponding arithmetic operation.
Error Handling:

The script includes a check to ensure the user's choice is valid (1, 2, 3, or 4).
It also handles division by zero, preventing the program from crashing and providing an error message instead.
Usage:

Users can run this script in a Python environment to perform basic arithmetic calculations interactively.
This calculator script is a simple example that can be extended or modified to include additional features, error handling improvements, or a more sophisticated user interface depending on specific requirements.
