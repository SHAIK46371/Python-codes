Creating a simple signup page in Python typically involves using a web framework. Flask is a lightweight web framework that's commonly used for such tasks. Below is a minimal example of a signup page using Flask. Please note that this is a basic example, and in a production environment, you would need to consider security aspects, form validation, and database integration.

First, you need to install Flask. You can do this using the following command:
pip install flask
Now, you can create a simple Flask application for a signup page:
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

# In-memory user database (in a real-world application, you'd use a database)
users = []

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('signup.html')

@app.route('/signup', methods=['POST'])
def signup():
    username = request.form['username']
    password = request.form['password']

    # In a real-world application, you would hash the password and store it securely
    users.append({'username': username, 'password': password})

    return redirect(url_for('success', username=username))

@app.route('/success/<username>')
def success(username):
    return f'Success! Welcome, {username}!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
